# OCSPcodetest
Code tests for Keyfactor by Christofer Vikstr√∂m.

## OCSPClient.java
A simple implementation of an OCSP client. It contains two methods: main and printOCSPResponse.

### main
This method initializes an OCSPClient object and invokes the printOCSPResponse method. For this code test, a given predefined byte array was provided. If it would fail, it catches the eventual Exception and prints a stacktrace.

### printOCSPResponse
This method takes a byte array representing an OCSP response as input, parses the response, and extracts information regarding the certificate using BouncyCastle. In this case, the current status of the certificate, the current update time, and the next update time. The method prints the response in the console, unless an exception happens during parsing, where an error message is printed instead.

## OCSPClientTest.java
This test class uses junit to try different responses for the OCSPClient class.

### testValidOCSPResponse
Hard coded the provided byte array and calls the printOCSPResponse. A successful test asserts true, a failed test prints the exception.

### testShortArray
Created a byte array that is too short and throws an IOException.

### testNullArray
The test invokes the printOCSPResponse will a null parameter, resulting in test asserting a NullPointerException.
